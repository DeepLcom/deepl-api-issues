# deepl-api-issues
Issue tracking repository for the DeepL API.

## Purpose of this repository

This repository is only used as an "Issue Tracker" for the general DeepL API. We sometimes get issue reports on our client libraries that affect the whole API, and are thus better suited for this repository. If you find a problem while using a client library (CL), but it is not CL-specific, please report it here, otherwise we will transfer the issue to this repository in the future.

### Examples of API-wide issues

Issues with translation quality, issues with individual features like tag handling, missing language support, etc.

### Examples of CL-specific issues

Unexpected exceptions thrown while using the library, installation/support issues while using the libraries, etc.
